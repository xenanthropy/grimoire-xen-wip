libshumate is a C library providing a GtkWidget to display maps.
It supports numerous free map sources such as OpenStreetMap,
OpenCycleMap, OpenAerialMap and Maps for free.

libshumate is named after Jessamine Shumate, an American artist, historian,
and cartographer. libshumate is forked from, and tries to follow similar
principles in the API as libchamplain.
The library is as of now still in early development.
