Software allows users to easily find,
discover and install apps. It also keeps their OS, apps and devices up to date
without them having to think about it, and gives them confidence that their
system is up to date. It supports popular distributions, subject to those
distributions maintaining their own distro-specific integration code.

(only installs flatpaks - does not manage system spells)
