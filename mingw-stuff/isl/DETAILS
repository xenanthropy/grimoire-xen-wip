isl is a library for manipulating sets and relations of integer points bounded
by linear constraints. Supported operations on sets include intersection,
union, set difference, emptiness check, convex hull, (integer) affine hull,
integer projection, computing the lexicographic minimum using parametric
integer programming, coalescing and parametric vertex enumeration. It also
includes an ILP solver based on generalized basis reduction, transitive
closures on maps (which may encode infinite graphs), dependence analysis
and bounds on piecewise step-polynomials. For more information see
the project page, the online user manual (html) or the complete manual
(pdf). For an introduction to the underlying concepts, see the first part
of the presentation Integer sets and relations: from high-level modeling to
low-level implementation . The barvinok package contains an iscc calculator
that exposes some of the operations supported by isl.
