cinnamon-desktop contains the libcinnamon-desktop library, the cinnamon-about
program as well as some desktop-wide documents.

The libcinnamon-desktop library provides API shared by several applications
on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
reasons. There is no API or ABI guarantee, although we are doing our
best to provide stability. Documentation for the API is available with
gtk-doc.
